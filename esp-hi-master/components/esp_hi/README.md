### Overview

ESP-Hi is an ultra-low-cost AI conversational robot based on ESP32-C3. By connecting to large language models (such as Xiao Zhi AI), it can achieve intelligent dialogue functionality. The built-in mercury switch can detect shaking, enabling wake-up and motion control. It integrates a 0.96-inch color screen for displaying expressions, and the robot dog has implemented over a dozen actions. Through full exploitation of ESP32-C3 peripherals, sound pickup and playback can be achieved with minimal board-level hardware. The software has been optimized simultaneously to reduce memory and flash usage, enabling wake word detection and multiple peripheral drivers under resource-constrained conditions.
